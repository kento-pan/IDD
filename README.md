# IID
**Instagram Image Downloader** for Mac, Windows and Linux.

IID will download the **original** image of an Instagram photo page in JPG format.

All you have to do is to start the script and copy & paste the photo id from the URL.

This is merely a Python exercise and me trying to get a hang of Github.
